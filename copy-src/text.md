## Employee or Freelancer?

### How to tell the difference

Your status is determined by the following six criteria:

- subordination to an employer
- financial liability
- ownership of tools
- whether your work is integral to the activities of your work provider
- whether your work ends upon achieving a specific result
- the agreement between you and your work provider


## Crunch and Overtime

### For employees

Overtime pay is due if you work more than your regular weekly hours.

- You are entitled to **an additional 50%** of your regular hourly pay.
- At the employee's request, this can be replaced with **equivalent paid leave
  plus 50%**.

Salaried employes **are** entitled to overtime pay.


You have the right to refuse work if:

- It is more than **2 hours** over a regular working day, or more than **14
  hours** per day.
- You have worked more than **12 hours** in a **24 hour period** on a variable
  or non-continuous schedule.
- You have worked more than **50 hours** in a week.
- You were not given at least **5 days** notice.

Your employer is **not allowed** to fire you, take away benefits, reduce wages
or punish you in any other way for excerising your rights.

### For freelancers

Freelancers should include a **rush rate** in their contract.


## Harassment

Behaviour that is **humiliating**, **offensive**, or **abusive**.

Exceeds what a "reasonable person" considers appropriate within the context of
their work, and is **repetitive in nature**.

Psychological harassment includes verbal comments, actions or gestures of a
sexual nature:

- that are hostile or unwanted
- that affect your dignity or physical or mental health
- that make the work environment harmful

Can occur on the basis of:

::: {custom-style="Cols-3"}
- Race
- Color
- Sex *
- Pregnancy
- Civil status
- Age
- Political convictions
- Disabilities
- Social condition
- Ethnic origin
- Language
- Sexual orientation
:::

*Sex refers to ?

::: {custom-style="Para-Bold"}
You have up to **2 years** to file a complaint.
:::

Try to **document** incidents whenever possible:

- **Keep a copy** of emails, texts, screenshots, etc. on a personal (not work!)
  device.
- **Keep a journal** with dates, times, locations, names, a description of events,
  and how it made you feel.

If your case is successful, the Labour Tribunal may order the employer to:

1.  reinstate you if you've been fired
2.  compensate you for lost wages
3.  take reasonable action to put a stop to the harassment
4.  pay punitive and moral damages

### Bill 176

New additions to Quebec's labor code regarding harassment.

“[Employers] must...adopt and make available to their employees a psychological
harassment prevention and complaint processing policy that includes, in
particular, a section on behaviour that manifests itself in the form of **verbal
comments, actions or gestures of a sexual nature**.”

- Bill 176 Section 81.19


## Standards and Benefits

Employers cannot give you worse working conditions or benefits than someone else
doing the same tasks at the same company based **solely on hiring date**.

This applies to:

- wages
- hours of work
- statutory general holidays and non-working days with pay
- paid annual leaves
- rest periods
- absences owing to sickness, accident or a criminal offence
- absences and leaves for family reasons or parental reasons
- notice of termination of employment or layoff and work certificate
- miscellaneous other standards (e.g. uniform)


## Termination

### For employees

You must be given **written** notice if you have worked for more than 3 months.

How much notice?

 Length of uninterrupted service    Notice Period
---------------------------------  ---------------
 3 months - 1 year                  1 week
 1 year - 5 years                   2 weeks
 5 - 10 years                       4 weeks
 10 years +                         8 weeks

- If you are not given sufficient notice, the employer must pay you an amount
  equal to what would have been earned during the notice period.
- This amount, as well as **any amount owed for vacation or overtime**, must be
  paid **at the time of dismissal**.

#### Exceptions (when no notice is required):

- you were hired for a specific task that has been completed
- you were on a fixed term contract, and the contract has ended
- you are being laid off temporarily for a period of less than 6 months

### Can contractors and freelancers quit early?

**Yes**, even without the client's consent.

You must have a serious reason:

- client repeatedly interferes with the work
- client refuses to cooperate
- client is abusive, disagreeable or impolite
- client tries to change the terms of your contract

Serious reasons **do not** include:

- if you did not charge a high enough price, **unless** it was due to
  misinformation given by the client
- the client is too demanding about performance
- the client has not paid certain small costs

You **can not** end the contract during a time that causes the client damage

- For example, the day before a big deadline
