## Who Are We?

### About Game Workers Unite Montréal

**GWU Montréal** is the local chapter of Game Workers Unite, an international
organization of people dedicated to advocating for workers' rights in the games
industry. GWU is not a union, but is helping organize workers across the
globe. Montréal is notable for the number of game companies it hosts – workers
here are a powerful force. Together, we can achieve better working conditions,
recognition, and mutual support for all.
