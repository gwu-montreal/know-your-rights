## Are You an Employee or a Freelancer?

### Here's how to tell the difference.

Your status is determined by the following six criteria:

1. Subordination to an employer. You are likely an employee if your employer:
    * Determines the conditions of your hiring and firing
    * Sets your schedule and decides where you will work
    * Defines your tasks and work methods
    * Manages your activities
    * Controls the execution of your work
    * Is able take disciplinary action against you
2. Financial liability
    * Freelancers must cover their own business operating costs, and can make profits and losses
    * Employees generally assume no financial risk
3. Ownership of tools
    * Freelancers supply their own tools
    * Employees generally use tools owned by their employer
4. Whether your work is integral to the activities of your work provider
    * Freelancers’ work is generally not integral
5. Whether your work ends upon achieving a specific result
    * Freelancers are hired to achieve a specific result and have freedom to determine how they will achieve that result
    * Employees are usually hired for a period of time
6. The agreement between you and your work provider
    * Different aspects of your contract affect classification
    * Does your contract refer to you as an employee or an independent contractor? (note: this alone does not determine status)
    * If you receive severance pay, or are eligible for your employers’ health benefits package, you are also more likely to be considered an employee

Note that different entities (the CRA, CNESST, the courts) may come to different conclusions in determining whether a worker is an independent contractor (freelancer) or employee.

## Crunch and Overtime

### For Employees:

Overtime pay is due if you work more than your regular weekly hours.

- You are entitled to **an additional 50%** of your regular hourly pay.
- At your request, this can be replaced with **equivalent paid leave
  plus 50%**.

Salaried employees **are** entitled to overtime pay.


You have the right to refuse work if:

- It is more than **2 hours** after regular daily working hours or more than 
  **14 working hours** per twenty-four hour period, whichever period is the shortest.
- You have worked more than **12 hours** in a **24 hour period** on a variable
  or non-continuous schedule.
- You have worked more than **50 hours** in a week.
- You were not given at least **5 days** notice, **unless** the nature of the job
  requires that you remain available (for example, emergency services).

::: {custom-style="Para-Bold"}
Your employer is **not allowed** to fire you, take away benefits, reduce wages
or punish you in any other way for excerising your rights.
:::

### For Freelancers:

Freelancers should include a **rush rate** in their contract.


## Harassment

Behaviour that is **humiliating**, **offensive**, or **abusive**.

Exceeds what a "reasonable person" considers appropriate within the context of
their work, and is **repetitive in nature**.

Psychological harassment includes verbal comments, actions or gestures of a
sexual nature:

- that are hostile or unwanted
- that affect your dignity or physical or mental health
- that make the work environment harmful

Can occur on the basis of:

::: {custom-style="Cols-2"}
- Race
- Color
- Sex
- Pregnancy
- Civil status
- Age
- Political convictions
- Disabilities
- Social condition
- Ethnic origin
- Language
- Sexual orientation
- Gender identity or expression
:::

::: {custom-style="Para-Bold"}
You have up to **2 years** to file a complaint.
:::

Try to **document** incidents whenever possible:

- **Keep a copy** of emails, texts, screenshots, etc. on a personal (not work!)
  device.
- **Keep a journal** with dates, times, locations, names, a description of events,
  and how it made you feel.

If your case is successful, the Labour Tribunal may order the employer to:

- reinstate you if you've been fired
- compensate you for lost wages
- take reasonable action to put a stop to the harassment
- pay punitive and moral damages

### Bill 176

New additions to Québec's labour code regarding harassment, in 2019.

“[Employers] must...adopt and make available to their employees a psychological
harassment prevention and complaint processing policy that includes, in
particular, a section on behaviour that manifests itself in the form of **verbal
comments, actions or gestures of a sexual nature**.”

::: {custom-style="Attribution"}
Bill 176 Section 81.19
:::

In other words, harassment policies must **specifically address sexual
harassment**.


## Standards and Benefits (Employees)

Employers cannot give you worse working conditions or benefits than someone else
doing the same tasks at the same company based **solely on hiring date**.

This applies to:

- wages
- hours of work
- statutory general holidays and non-working days with pay
- paid annual leaves
- rest periods
- absences owing to sickness, accident or a criminal offence
- absences and leaves for family reasons or parental reasons
- notice of termination of employment or layoff and work certificate
- miscellaneous other standards (e.g. uniform)


## Termination

### For Employees:

You must be given **written** notice if you have worked for more than 3 months.

How much notice?

+---------------------------+----------------+
| Length of                 | Notice Period  |
| uninterrupted service     |                |
+===========================+================+
| 3 months - 1 year         | 1 week         |
+---------------------------+----------------+
| 1 year - 5 years          | 2 weeks        |
+---------------------------+----------------+
| 5 - 10 years              | 4 weeks        |
+---------------------------+----------------+
| 10 years +                | 8 weeks        |
+---------------------------+----------------+

- If you are not given sufficient notice, the employer must pay you an amount
  equal to what would have been earned during the notice period.
- This amount, as well as **any amount owed for vacation or overtime**, must be
  paid **at the time of dismissal**.
- If you have worked at least 2 years uninterrupted for the same employer, they
  cannot fire you without **"good and sufficient cause."** In other words,
  **they must prove** that they had a serious reason for firing you. These
  reasons may include: **dishonesty**, **insubordination**, **negligence**,
  **incompetence** and **bad performance**. (See the glossary for definitions of
  some of these terms.) You have **up to 45 days after dismissal** to file a
  complaint with the CNESST.

Note that these protections do **not** apply to employees who have worked for
**less than 3 months.**

#### Exceptions (when no notice is required):

- you were hired for a specific task that has been completed
- you were on a fixed term contract, and the contract has ended
- you are being laid off temporarily for a period of less than 6 months

### Can contractors and freelancers quit early?

**Yes**, even without the client's consent. But you need to have a serious
reason:

- the client repeatedly interferes with the work
- the client refuses to cooperate
- the client is abusive, disagreeable or impolite
- the client tries to change the terms of your contract

Serious reasons **do not** include:

- if you did not charge a high enough price, **unless** it was due to
  misinformation given by the client
- the client is too demanding about performance
- the client has not paid certain small costs

You **can't** end the contract during a time that causes the client damage — for
example, the day before a big deadline.

::: {custom-style="Para-Bold"}
Your employer is **not allowed** to **fire you**, **take away benefits**, or
**reduce wages** if you are absent for any of these reasons for the allotted
time.
:::

Some conditions apply:

- in most cases employees must give notice as soon as possible
- if you are repeatedly absent your employer can request a document attesting to
  the reasons for your absence (for example, a doctor's note)

## Vacations (Employees)

+--------------------+--------------------------+
| Employment length  | Vacation & indemnity     |
+====================+==========================+
| 1 year             | - 1 day/month of service |
|                    | - 4% of wages earned     |
+--------------------+--------------------------+
| 1 - 3 years        | - 2 weeks                |
|                    | - 4% of wages earned     |
+--------------------+--------------------------+
| 3 years or more    | - 3 weeks                |
|                    | - 6% of wages earned     |
+--------------------+--------------------------+

- indemnities (additional sums of money that do not include wages) are
  calculated based on the wages you earned during the previous year
- indemnities must be paid as a lump sum before the start of your vacation
- an employee who is already entitled to 2 weeks can take **1 additional week of
  unpaid leave**


## Statutory Holidays (Employees)

Paid days off include:

- **New Years Day** - January 1
- **Good Friday or Easter Monday** - before/after Easter Sunday
- **National Patriotes Day** - Monday before May 25
- **St. Jean Baptiste Day** - June 24 (Québec only)
- **Canada Day** - July 1
- **Labour Day** - 1st Monday of September
- **Thanksgiving** - 2nd Monday of October
- **Christmas Day** - December 25

If a statutory holiday falls on a non-work day **another day will be subsituted**.

### Exceptions

- An employee needs to have worked at least 30 days to be entitled to holiday
  pay
- Statutory holidays do not apply to contract workers


## Reprisals (Employees)

Your employer or manager **cannot** dismiss, suspend or transfer, discriminate
against, or punish you

- for exercising any of the rights covered under the Labour Act
- for filing a complaint with the Commission des Normes du Travail, or providing
  evidence for an investigation
- on the grounds that you are pregnant or paying child support
- because you refused to do overtime in order to look after your child or close
  relative (if you are their primary caretaker)
- because you’ve reached the age of retirement, or to avoid meeting obligations
  under the Voluntary Retirement Savings Plan Act

If your rights are violated, you have up to **45 days** to make a complaint to
the Commission des normes du travail.


## Intellectual Property

In the absence of an agreement to the contrary, the copyright to works created
by **an employee** in the course of their employment will automatically be
**owned by the employer**.

- Be careful to avoid using employer property (computers, etc.) to create works
  outside of the job description/work hours.


In the absence of an agreement **in writing** to the contrary, the copyright to
works created by an independent contractor **remain their own**.

- Before signing an agreement, think carefully about whether giving your client
  ownership over your IP will prevent you from being able to do your work as you
  normally do.


## NDAs, non-competition, etc.
### 3 common restrictive covenants in contracts:

- **Non-hire**: restricts a worker from hiring or working with other
  employees/contractors of the employer/client
- **Non-solicit**: restricts a worker from soliciting clients (and sometimes
  suppliers or others) of the employer/client
- **Non-competition**: restricts a worker from working for another business that
  competes with the employer/client, and this could include as a freelancer

With all of 3 of these clauses, as well as NDAs, it is important to **understand the scope**.
Does it continue after the working relationship ends, and for how long?
Non-competition provisions should specify what constitutes a competitive
business, and where the restriction applies (city, province, country, online,
etc).

**Read contracts before you sign them**. Make sure you understand what the
contract is saying and that it matches your understanding of the agreed-upon
terms.

### Every contract is negotiable, but you need leverage!


## Unionization Rights

#### Every worker has the right to join, form, or participate in a union of their choice.

#### Restrictions on employers

- no employer or employer’s association (e.g. La Guilde, ESA) can try to
  dominate, hinder, finance, or participate in the formation or activities of a
  union
- employers are not allowed to threaten or intimidate you to prevent you from
  joining a union
- employers are not allowed to refuse to hire you, fire you, or use any other
  form of punishment against you because you have joined or participated in
  union activities
- if they claim to be firing/punishing you for other reasons, they have to
  **prove it** (that is, the burden of proof lies with the employer)

#### Restrictions on union activities

- you are not allowed to ask people to join your union during working hours
- you can’t hold union meetings at the workplace unless you have the permission
  of your employer

You have **30 days** to file a complaint with the Labour Tribunal.

### Some benefits of collective action:

- You'll have **stronger negotiating power** to win improvements at your
  workplace compared to trying to change things as an individual.
- As a freelancer, you ultimately have very few rights and protections under
  Québec labour law. When freelancers join together, we can help protect
  ourselves right now _and_ push for better labour laws for everyone in the long
  term.
- On top of legal reform, unions help transform and improve your whole industry
  for **every worker** by helping to establish standards and expectations.
- Unions can help democratize company policies and politics.
- Unions can also help **put a stop to employee misclassification** (when employers
  treat workers who should be employees as freelancers in order to deny them basic rights)
  and the loss of benefits that almost always entails.

**Many employers get away with violating the legal rights of their workers** because
those workers aren't unionized and have no way to fight back. **Unionizing is the best
way to ensure our rights are respected.** If you suspect your rights are being violated,
or are curious what the next steps are, **Game Workers Unite and S'ATTAQ are here to help
you** - don't hesistate to contact us!
