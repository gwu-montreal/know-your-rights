## Are You an Employee or a Freelancer?

### Here's how to tell the difference.

Your status is determined by the following six criteria:

- subordination to an employer
- financial liability
- ownership of tools
- whether your work is integral to the activities of your work provider
- whether your work ends upon achieving a specific result
- the agreement between you and your work provider


## Crunch and Overtime

### For Employees:

Overtime pay is due if you work more than your regular weekly hours.

- You are entitled to **an additional 50%** of your regular hourly pay.
- At the employee's request, this can be replaced with **equivalent paid leave
  plus 50%**.

Salaried employes **are** entitled to overtime pay.


You have the right to refuse work if:

- It is more than **2 hours** over a regular working day, or more than **14
  hours** per day.
- You have worked more than **12 hours** in a **24 hour period** on a variable
  or non-continuous schedule.
- You have worked more than **50 hours** in a week.
- You were not given at least **5 days** notice, **unless** the nature of the job
  requires that you remain available (for example, emergency services).

Your employer is **not allowed** to fire you, take away benefits, reduce wages
or punish you in any other way for excerising your rights.
:::

### For Freelancers:

Freelancers should include a **rush rate** in their contract.


## Harassment

Behaviour that is **humiliating**, **offensive**, or **abusive**.

Exceeds what a "reasonable person" considers appropriate within the context of
their work, and is **repetitive in nature**.

Psychological harassment includes verbal comments, actions or gestures of a
sexual nature:

- that are hostile or unwanted
- that affect your dignity or physical or mental health
- that make the work environment harmful

Can occur on the basis of:

::: {custom-style="Cols-2"}
- Race
- Color
- Sex
- Pregnancy
- Civil status
- Age
- Political convictions
- Disabilities
- Social condition
- Ethnic origin
- Language
- Sexual orientation
- Gender identity or expression
:::

::: {custom-style="Para-Bold"}
You have up to **2 years** to file a complaint.
:::

Try to **document** incidents whenever possible:

- **Keep a copy** of emails, texts, screenshots, etc. on a personal (not work!)
  device.
- **Keep a journal** with dates, times, locations, names, a description of events,
  and how it made you feel.

If your case is successful, the Labour Tribunal may order the employer to:

- reinstate you if you've been fired
- compensate you for lost wages
- take reasonable action to put a stop to the harassment
- pay punitive and moral damages

### Bill 176

New additions to Québec's labour code regarding harassment.

“[Employers] must...adopt and make available to their employees a psychological
harassment prevention and complaint processing policy that includes, in
particular, a section on behaviour that manifests itself in the form of **verbal
comments, actions or gestures of a sexual nature**.”

::: {custom-style="Attribution"}
Bill 176 Section 81.19
:::

In other words, harassment policies must **specifically address sexual
harassment**.


## Standards and Benefits

Employers cannot give you worse working conditions or benefits than someone else
doing the same tasks at the same company based **solely on hiring date**.

This applies to:

- wages
- hours of work
- statutory general holidays and non-working days with pay
- paid annual leaves
- rest periods
- absences owing to sickness, accident or a criminal offence
- absences and leaves for family reasons or parental reasons
- notice of termination of employment or layoff and work certificate
- miscellaneous other standards (e.g. uniform)


## Termination

### For Employees:

You must be given **written** notice if you have worked for more than 3 months.

How much notice?

+---------------------------+----------------+
| Length of                 | Notice Period  |
| uninterrupted service     |                |
+===========================+================+
| 3 months - 1 year         | 1 week         |
+---------------------------+----------------+
| 1 year - 5 years          | 2 weeks        |
+---------------------------+----------------+
| 5 - 10 years              | 4 weeks        |
+---------------------------+----------------+
| 10 years +                | 8 weeks        |
+---------------------------+----------------+

- If you are not given sufficient notice, the employer must pay you an amount
  equal to what would have been earned during the notice period.
- This amount, as well as **any amount owed for vacation or overtime**, must be
  paid **at the time of dismissal**.
- If you have worked at least 2 years uninterrupted for the same employer, they
  cannot fire you without **"good and sufficient cause."** In other words,
  **they must prove** that they had a serious reason for firing you. These
  reasons may include: **dishonesty**, **insubordination**, **negligence**,
  **incompetence** and **bad performance**. (See the glossary for definitions of
  some of these terms.) You have **up to 45 days after dismissal** to file a
  complaint with the CNESST.

Note that these protections do **not** apply to employees who have worked for
**less than 3 months.**

#### Exceptions (when no notice is required):

- you were hired for a specific task that has been completed
- you were on a fixed term contract, and the contract has ended
- you are being laid off temporarily for a period of less than 6 months

### Can contractors and freelancers quit early?

**Yes**, even without the client's consent. But you need to have a serious
reason:

- the client repeatedly interferes with the work
- the client refuses to cooperate
- the client is abusive, disagreeable or impolite
- the client tries to change the terms of your contract

Serious reasons **do not** include:

- if you did not charge a high enough price, **unless** it was due to
  misinformation given by the client
- the client is too demanding about performance
- the client has not paid certain small costs

You **can't** end the contract during a time that causes the client damage — for
example, the day before a big deadline.

**reduce wages** if you are absent for any of these reasons for the allotted
time.
:::

Some conditions apply:

- in most cases employees must give notice as soon as possible
- if you are repeatedly absent your employer can request a document attesting to
  the reasons for your absence (for example, a doctor's note)

## Vacations

+--------------------+--------------------------+
| Employment length  | Vacation & indemnity     |
+====================+==========================+
| 1 year             | - 1 day/month of service |
|                    | - 4% of wages earned     |
+--------------------+--------------------------+
| 1 - 3 years        | - 2 weeks                |
|                    | - 4% of wages earned     |
+--------------------+--------------------------+
| 3 years or more    | - 3 weeks                |
|                    | - 6% of wages earned     |
+--------------------+--------------------------+

- indemnities (additional sums of money that do not include wages) are
  calculated based on the wages you earned during the previous year
- indemnities must be paid as a lump sum before the start of your vacation
- an employee who is already entitled to 2 weeks can take **1 additional week of
  unpaid leave**


## Statutory Holidays

Paid days off include:

- **New Years Day** - January 1
- **Good Friday or Easter Monday** - before/after Easter Sunday
- **National Patriotes Day** - Monday before May 25
- **St. Jean Baptiste Day** - June 24 (Québec only)
- **Canada Day** - July 1
- **Labour Day** - 1st Monday of September
- **Thanksgiving** - 2nd Monday of October
- **Christmas Day** - December 25

If a statutory holiday falls on a non-work day **another day will be subsituted**.

### Exceptions

- An employee needs to have worked at least 30 days to be entitled to holiday
  pay
- Statutory holidays do not apply to contract workers


## Recourse

Your employer or manager **cannot** dismiss, suspend or transfer, discriminate
against, or punish you

- for exercising any of the rights covered under the Labour Act
- for filing a complaint with the Commission des Normes du Travail, or providing
  evidence for an investigation
- on the grounds that you are pregnant or paying child support
- because you refused to do overtime in order to look after your child or close
  relative (if you are their primary caretaker)
- because you’ve reached the age of retirement, or to avoid meeting obligations
  under the Voluntary Retirement Savings Plan Act

If your rights are violated, you have up to **45 days** to make a complaint to
the Commission des normes du travail.


## Intellectual Property

In the absence of an agreement to the contrary, the copyright to works created
by **an employee** in the course of their employment will automatically be
**owned by the employer**.

- Be careful to avoid using employer property (computers, etc.) to create works
  outside of the job description/work hours.


In the absence of an agreement **in writing** to the contrary, the copyright to
works created by an independent contractor **remain their own**.

- Before signing an agreement, think carefully about whether giving your client
  ownership over your IP will prevent you from being able to do your work as you
  normally do.


## NDAs, non-competition, etc.
### 3 common restrictive covenants in contracts:

- **Non-hire**: restricts a worker from hiring or working with other
  employees/contractors of the employer/client
- **Non-solicit**: restricts a worker from soliciting clients (and sometimes
  suppliers or others) of the employer/client
- **Non-competition**: restricts a worker from working for another business that
  competes with the employer/client, and this could include as a freelancer

With all of 3 of these clauses, it is important to **understand the scope**.
Does it continue after the working relationship ends, and for how long?
Non-competition provisions should specify what constitutes a competitive
business, and where the restriction applies (city, province, country, online,
etc).

**Read contracts before you sign them**. Make sure you understand what the
contract is saying and that it matches your understanding of the agreed-upon
terms.

### Every contract is negotiable, but you need leverage!


## Unionization Rights

#### Every employee has the right to join, form, or participate in a union of their choice.

#### Restrictions on employers

- no employer or employer’s association (e.g. La Guilde, ESA) can try to
  dominate, hinder, finance, or participate in the formation or activities of a
  union
- employers are not allowed to threaten or intimidate you to prevent you from
  joining a union
- employers are not allowed to refuse to hire you, fire you, or use any other
  form of punishment against you because you have joined or participated in
  union activities
- if they claim to be firing/punishing you for other reasons, they have to
  **prove it** (that is, the burden of proof lies with the employer)

#### Restrictions on union activities

- you are not allowed to ask people to join your union during working hours
- you can’t hold union meetings at the workplace unless you have the permission
  of your employer

You have **30 days** to file a complaint with the Labour Tribunal.

### Some benefits of collective action:

- You'll have **stronger negotiating power** to win improvements at your
  workplace compared to trying to change things as an individual.
- As a freelancer, you ultimately have very few rights and protections under
  Québec labour law. When freelancers join together, we can help protect
  ourselves right now _and_ push for better labour laws for everyone in the long
  term.
- On top of legal reform, unions help transform and improve your whole industry
  for **every worker** by helping to establish standards and expectations.
- Unions can help democratize company policies and politics.
- Unions can also help **put a stop to employee misclassification** and the loss
  of benefits that almost always entails.
