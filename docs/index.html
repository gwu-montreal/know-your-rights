<h3 id="how-to-tell-the-difference">How to tell the difference</h3>
<p>Your status is determined by the following six criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>subordination to an employer</li>
<li>financial liability</li>
<li>ownership of tools</li>
<li>whether your work is integral to the activities of your work provider</li>
<li>whether your work ends upon achieving a specific result</li>
<li>the agreement between you and your work provider</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="crunch-and-overtime">Crunch and Overtime</h2>
<h3 id="for-employees">For employees</h3>
<p>Overtime pay is due if you work more than your regular weekly hours.</p>
<ul>
<li>You are entitled to <strong>an additional 50%</strong> of your regular hourly pay.</li>
<li>At the employee’s request, this can be replaced with <strong>equivalent paid leave plus 50%</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Salaried employes <strong>are</strong> entitled to overtime pay.</p>
<p>You have the right to refuse work if:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is more than <strong>2 hours</strong> over a regular working day, or more than <strong>14 hours</strong> per day.</li>
<li>You have worked more than <strong>12 hours</strong> in a <strong>24 hour period</strong> on a variable or non-continuous schedule.</li>
<li>You have worked more than <strong>50 hours</strong> in a week.</li>
<li>You were not given at least <strong>5 days</strong> notice, unless the nature of the job requires that you remain available (for example emergency services).</li>

<h2 id="harassment">Harassment</h2>
<p>Behaviour that is <strong>humiliating</strong>, <strong>offensive</strong>, or <strong>abusive</strong>.</p>
<p>Exceeds what a “reasonable person” considers appropriate within the context of their work, and is <strong>repetitive in nature</strong>.</p>
<p>Psychological harassment includes verbal comments, actions or gestures of a sexual nature:</p>
<ul>
<li>that are hostile or unwanted</li>
<li>that affect your dignity or physical or mental health</li>
<li>that make the work environment harmful</li>
</ul>
<p>Can occur on the basis of:</p>
<div data-custom-style="Cols-2">
<ul>
<li>Race</li>
<li>Color</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Keep a copy</strong> of emails, texts, screenshots, etc. on a personal (not work!) device.</li>
<li><strong>Keep a journal</strong> with dates, times, locations, names, a description of events, and how it made you feel.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your case is successful, the Labour Tribunal may order the employer to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>reinstate you if you’ve been fired</li>
<li>compensate you for lost wages</li>
<li>take reasonable action to put a stop to the harassment</li>
<li>pay punitive and moral damages</li>

<h3 id="bill-176">Bill 176</h3>
<p>New additions to Quebec’s labor code regarding harassment.</p>
<p>“[Employers] must…adopt and make available to their employees a psychological harassment prevention and complaint processing policy that includes, in particular, a section on behaviour that manifests itself in the form of <strong>verbal comments, actions or gestures of a sexual nature</strong>.”</p>
<div data-custom-style="Attribution">
<p>Bill 176 Section 81.19</p>

<li>This amount, as well as <strong>any amount owed for vacation or overtime</strong>, must be paid <strong>at the time of dismissal</strong>.</li>
<li>If you have worked at least 2 years uninterrupted for the same employer, they cannot fire you without <strong>“good and sufficient cause.”</strong> In other words they must prove that they had a serious reason for firing you.

</ul>
<p>In the absence of an agreement <strong>in writing</strong> to the contrary, the copyright to works created by an independent contractor <strong>remain their own</strong>.</p>

<li><strong>Non-competition</strong>: restricts a worker from working for another business that competes with the employer/client, and this could include as a freelancer</li>
</ul>
<p>With all of 3 of these clauses, it is important to <strong>understand the scope</strong>. Does it continue after the working relationship ends, and for how long? Non-competition provisions should specify what constitutes a competitive business, and where the restriction applies (city, province, country, online, etc).</p>
<p><strong>Read contracts before you sign them</strong>. Make sure you understand what the contract is saying and that it matches your understanding of the agreed-upon terms.</p>

<li>Democratize company politics and policies</li>
<li>Stop employee misclassification and loss of benefits</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="glossary">Glossary</h2>
<h3 id="claim">Claim</h3>
<p>An action by the Commission which consists of claiming, on its own behalf or on behalf of an employee, a sum of money from an employer to enforce certain provisions of the law.</p>
<h3 id="collective-agreement">Collective Agreement</h3>
<p>There are many definitions of a collective agreement, but as it’s defined by the Québec Labour Code, it is “an agreement in writing respecting conditions of employment made between one or more certified associations and one or more employers or employers’ associations.”</p>
<p>A collective agreement is usually (but not always) one of the key negotiating points of a unionized workforce, and typically grants better employment conditions for workers. A collective agreement may also come with certain limitations; for example, it may forbid workers from going on strike.</p>
<h3 id="compensatory-leave">Compensatory Leave</h3>
<p>A leave granted to you in place of an indemnity (see definition below) that was supposed to be paid, or for a paid leave you didn’t benefit from.</p>
<p>It may happen that a compensatory leave is granted to you in place of payment for overtime worked. If this happens, by law this leave must constitute a condition of employment that is “more advantageous” for you.</p>
<h3 id="complainant">Complainant</h3>
<p>A natural or legal person that files a complaint because they believe that the employer infringed on a right granted by law.</p>
<p>“Legal person” in this specific context refers to any non-profit organization dedicated to defending workers’ rights. If an organization is representing you as a complainant, you have to authorize them to do so in writing.</p>
<h3 id="conditions-of-employment">Conditions of Employment</h3>
<p>All of the favorable or unfavorable factors surrounding the accomplishment of work by the employees in an undertaking. Remuneration, fringe benefits, workplace layout, disciplinary system and leaves are part of the conditions of employment in the broad sense of the expression.</p>
<h3 id="contract-of-employment">Contract of Employment</h3>
<p>An agreement whereby a person undertakes to work under certain conditions under the authority of another in return for remuneration, be it for a fixed term or an open-ended period.</p>
<h3 id="disciplinary-measure-sanction">Disciplinary Measure Sanction</h3>
<p>A repressive measure or punishment that your employer takes against you for an infraction you may have committed, like insubordination (see definition below) or negligence. Note that incompetence is <strong>not</strong> considered an infraction that can be disciplined.</p>
<p>A disciplinary sanction could consist of (amongst other things) a warning, a fine, loss of benefits, a suspension, demotion, or dismissal. But it’s important to note that your employer <strong>can’t</strong> do many of these things if they’re not explicitly mentioned in your contract: for example, if you’re granted a certain benefit as part of your contract, it can’t be taken away from you as a sanction unless that’s also noted in the contract.</p>
<h3 id="discriminatory-measure">Discriminatory Measure</h3>
<p>Any measure or action an employer takes that adversely affects your job or employment conditions by treating you differently from other employees by reason of your sex, race, religion, age, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, opinions (such as political convictions) or personal situation (such as whether you are homeless, a student, etc.).</p>
<p>The dismissal of an employee because they are pregnant or the forced retirement of an employee due to their age are examples of discriminatory measures.</p>
<h3 id="disloyalty">Disloyalty</h3>
<p>The law in Québec requires an employee to be “loyal” towards their employer. This means that under the law, while employed you have an obligation to:</p>
<ul>
<li>be honest with your employer.</li>
<li>use good judgment in your role as an employee.</li>
<li>put the interests of your employer above your own (with caveats; see “insubordination” below).</li>
<li>protect confidential information.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dismissal">Dismissal</h3>
<p>Dismissal consists of definitively interrupting the employment of an employee whose behaviour is called into question by their employer. In certain cases, the non-renewal of a contract or the failure to recall the employee to work may constitute a dismissal.</p>
<h3 id="employee">Employee</h3>
<p>A person who works for an employer and who is entitled to a wage. If you have a contract that entails performing some work in exchange for some sum of money, you’re also most likely considered an employee. This includes, for example, a contract where you’re provided a lump sum from which you’re expected to deduct expenses for raw materials or equipment and then keep the remaining amount.</p>
<h3 id="employer">Employer</h3>
<p>A natural or legal person that has work carried out, in return for remuneration, by one or more employees on their behalf and under their subordination.</p>
<h3 id="employment">Employment</h3>
<p>Remunerated activity that usually entails obligations, responsibilities and requiring specific professional qualifications.</p>
<h3 id="fixed-term-contract">Fixed-Term Contract</h3>
<p>A contract of employment stipulating a beginning and an end and binding the parties until its expiry either by a date or by a precise event that is to take place.</p>
<p>The end of the harvest or an objective to be attained are examples of events that may be used to set the expiry of a fixed term contract. In these specific cases, the Act uses the expression “contract for specific services” instead of “fixed-term contract.”</p>
<h3 id="good-and-sufficient-cause">Good and Sufficient Cause</h3>
<p>An employer can’t fire you without a some kind of solid justification or reason. This reason has to represent “good and sufficient cause” for dismissal.</p>
<p>A good and sufficient cause does not generally entail an immediate breach of the contract of employment and does not release your employer from having to give you notice of termination.</p>
<p>Disloyalty (see above), insubordination (see below), and incompetence are reasons that may justify dismissal.</p>
<h3 id="incremental-nature-of-sanctions">Incremental Nature of Sanctions</h3>
<p>Your employer usually isn’t allowed to dismiss you outright for any infractions you may have committed (short of those infractions constituting “serious fault”; see the definition of that below). Instead, these infractions must be met by your employer with “gradual punishment”; this is the principle of the “incremental nature of sanctions.”</p>
<p>Under the law, this “incremental nature” may also vary according to the type of work you’re doing and the seriousness of the infraction.</p>
<h3 id="indemnity">Indemnity</h3>
<p>A sum of money paid to you either to compensate for prejudice against you, or to compensate for a leave, or under certain other circumstances (such as a workplace injury).</p>
<h3 id="insubordination">Insubordination</h3>
<p>Refusal to comply with the “general discipline of the enterprise,” to perform work, or to execute a legitimate order of your employer with the intention of resisting or challenging their authority may be considered “insubordination” under the law, and may constitute “good and sufficient cause” (see definition above) for your dismissal.</p>
<p>You cannot be charged with insubordination for refusing to perform work that endangers your health or safety. You also have the right to refuse to obey an order that would constitute an illegal act or that is “contrary to public order or morality.”</p>
<h3 id="layoff-notice">Layoff Notice</h3>
<p>Written notice that must comply with the conditions and the time periods set by the Act and which the employer is required to give the employee before laying them off for six months or more.</p>
<h3 id="manager">Manager</h3>
<p>An employee who performs a management role and who has the necessary authority to make decisions that are binding on their employer. The definition of the term “employee” in the Labour Code (Québec) excludes “managers.”</p>
<h3 id="overtime">Overtime</h3>
<p>Hours worked over and above the duration of the standard workweek and which are usually remunerated at a premium rate. The length of the regular workweek is set by law, but may also be negotiated between an employer and employee in a contract or other agreement.</p>
<h3 id="pecuniary-complaint">Pecuniary Complaint</h3>
<p>This type of complaint deals with infractions related to wages and indemnities.</p>
<h3 id="permanent-layoff">Permanent Layoff</h3>
<p>A permanent layoff consists of definitively interrupting the employment of an employee due to a change in the workforce needs.</p>
<h3 id="person">Person</h3>
<p>In Québec labour law, you may see reference to the term “natural or legal person” (or “personne physique ou morale” in French). A “natural person” is an individual — say, yourself, or someone who offers you an employment contract on their own behalf rather than on behalf of a business.</p>
<p>A “legal person” is a firm or organization. For example, a business that employs you does so as a legal person. And if you file a complaint with the Commission des Normes du Travail, a legal person could be an organization that represents you and helps you represent your case (see the definition of “complainant” above).</p>
<h3 id="plaintiff">Plaintiff</h3>
<p>See “complainant” above.</p>
<h3 id="professional-misconduct">Professional Misconduct</h3>
<p>If something you’ve done while performing your job results in harmful consequences for an employer or client, this might be considered “professional misconduct” under the law. Professional misconduct may be “good and sufficient cause” (see definition above) for dismissal and even constitute “serious fault,” (see definition below) depending on the circumstances.</p>
<h3 id="reasonable-person">Reasonable Person</h3>
<p>When an employee claims to be a victim of harassment, a “reasonable person” is someone who is well-informed of the circumstances and is in the same situation as the employee, and who would also conclude that the behaviour the employee was subject to constitutes harassment.</p>
<h3 id="reasonable-time-period">Reasonable Time Period</h3>
<p>If you’ve been terminated with notice (see the “Termination” section of the pamphlet), the notice period must be “reasonable.” Amongst other things, this means it must take into account, the kind of job you’re performing, the particular circumstances under which you work, and the amount of time for which you’ve been employed.</p>
<h3 id="reprisal">Reprisal</h3>
<p>An employer isn’t allowed to fire, suspend, dismiss, or transfer you for exercising your rights under the law. They’re also not allowed to punish you for doing so in any other way that adversely affects your job or employment conditions. Any such punishment is illegal, and is known as a “reprisal.” See the “Recourse” section of the pamphlet for a (non-exhaustive) list of other reasons an employer can’t take reprisals against you (for example, for being pregnant).</p>
<h3 id="serious-fault">Serious Fault</h3>
<p>A serious fault is something you’ve done (or failed to do) under the terms of your employment that’s considered serious enough to allow the employer to fire you without the normal obligation of notice of termination.</p>
<p>This can be a single major action (or omission) on your part. But the law might also consider it a serious fault if there’s a series of smaller issues that an employer has given you “serious warnings” about but that continue to happen.</p>
<h3 id="spouse">Spouse</h3>
<p>Under Québec law, you’re a “spouse” if you’re married (or in a civil union) with someone and living with them, OR if you have a child with someone and are living with them, OR if you’re in a relationship with someone (a “de facto union”) and have been living with them for a year or more.</p>
<h3 id="uninterrupted-service">Uninterrupted Service</h3>
<p>An uninterrupted period during which you’re under an employment contract. This includes times within that period when you aren’t working but during which the contract is still in effect.</p>
<p>If you have multiple consecutive fixed-term contracts with an employer in succession (without an interruption that would lead one to believe that the contract isn’t renewed), this is also considered a period of uninterrupted service.</p>
